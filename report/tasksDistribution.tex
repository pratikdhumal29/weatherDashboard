\hline
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Tasks s-he accomplished} \\
\hline
Aubry Cholleton & \begin{itemize}
	\item Find NOAA datasets on the web and resources about it.
	\item Write a generic algorithm to filter and aggregate data from NOAA (temporally and spatially), perform some statistics and classification of extreme events and output the results.
	\item Apply this algorithm to temperature anomalies.
	\item Write python scripts to convert Hadoop output to geoJSON, to transform coordinate systems and to interpolate data.
	\item Visualizations of temperature anomalies in javascript using leaflet for the map and geoJSON file format.
	\item Integrate visualization of rainfall events.
	\item Project leading and presentation.
\end{itemize}\\

Jonathan Duss & \\
\hline
Anders Asheim Hennum & \begin{itemize}
	\item Developed and implemented $k$-nearest neighbor with Map Reduce
	\item Formatted and analyzed data with R
	\item Visualized data as graph with D3.js
\end{itemize}\\
\hline
Alexis Kessel & \begin{itemize}
	\item Find and extract location, date, nature of extreme weather events from Weather data. Overall, locate places which tend to get more extreme weather events.
	\item Extract Rain information from NOAA datasets and filter inconsistent rain data.
	\item Write a generic algorithm to aggregate temporally extreme events.
	\item Find matching extreme events on map, both temporally and spatially, with the Wikipedia articles.
\end{itemize}\\
