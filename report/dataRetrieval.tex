\section{Data Retrieval}
\subsection{Looking for data}
Initially, the project idea was to get Alps weather information from social networks using natural language processing. Hence we first looked how to mine Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Camptocamp. We also searched for other datasources such as the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF), MeteoSuisse or ski resorts. After discussion and clarification with our TA, the scope and goal of our project changed in order to get closer to a \emph{Big Data} project. Hence we needed to process a big dataset and the NCDC dataset from NOAA seems to be the one.

\subsection{The NCDC dataset from NOAA}
The \emph{National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration} (NOAA) is the US agency responsible for the weather surveillance and forecast. They appear to have a \emph{National Climatic Data Center} (NCDC), “responsible for preserving, monitoring, assessing, and providing public access to the Nation's treasure of climate and historical weather data and information”.
