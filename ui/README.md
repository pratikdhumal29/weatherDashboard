#Adding your visualization
Add your html file in the folder `pages`. This file should contain only what must be contained between the tags `<body></body>`.

In your code, you should also consider that your data is in a directory contained in the directory `data`. e.i., for storms, the data will be in the directory `data/storms`. Also, your code is integrated the index file so you should write the path to your data as if you were in the same directory as the index file (`ui`) and not as if it is in the `pages` directory.

**Don't upload any data in the directory `data` on GitHub.**  
The directory is on GitHub just to show you where the data will be.
